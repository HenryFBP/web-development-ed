          <h2>Magnetic Memory</h2>
          <br>
                A new era of magnetic storage was introduced by IBM when they came about the magnetic tape drive vacuum column in 1952. Magnetic storage was a stepping stone to a world of digital storage. Prior to the existence of the tape, information was saved on a punch card in a form of tangible data. The IBM 726 had a capacity of storing 2 million digits per tape, which was an astonishing amount of numbers during that time. About a decade later, Philips introduced the audio cassette which stores audio records on a magnetic tape. Greater innovations by IBM lead to the development of the floppy disk which is a removable magnetic disk enclosed with hard plastic used for storing data. The floppy disk was cheap compared to other memory storing devices and fairly simple to make. However, floppy disks had a low storage capacity of 1.44MB with a slow process of transferring data. The floppy disk had a creative design of having a rigid metal cover protecting the magnetic film because it is very prone to be damaged by dirt, dust, or warring off causing errors and at time complete failures of the tape. Today, the most efficient magnetic memory storage is hard disk drives. With hard disk drives you have easy access to data within seconds opposed to a VHS or magnetic tape cassette where its in a sequential format. According to the report of “Hard drive” on Computer Hope, similarly to magnetic tapes hard disk drives are useful for holding large amounts of data such as archives and back ups, most of which are around 3 TB.

    <h2> Memory Evolution</h2>

    <br>
    Over the years’ magnetic memory has evolved in many ways and has advanced greatly in capacity and speed. Year by year storage devices are becoming more affordable. One of the first iPods had a capacity of 1 GB storage, now an iPod with the same design and same size is 125 GB. According to Investopedia, an online encyclopedia, this is in support of Moore’s law, which is an observation and predication of a pattern that information density will double every two years. At around 100Gbits/in^2 might cause a risk called super paramagnetic effect, that occurs when the magnetic grains are reduced in size or crammed together. Heat energy can disturb the magnetization of a magnetic grain when its volume is too small. This may lead to bit manipulation and data loss. To solve this issue scientist’s changed the direction of recording from longitudinal to perpendicular, expanding the approach of areal density. Many organizations still use magnetic tapes to hold enormous amount of data, usually back up data because tapes are less prone to ware out sitting on a shelf. For that purpose, in 2014, Sony introduced a storage type that has the capacity of 185 TB. A project that is only in prototype right now is Heat-Assisted Magnetic Recording (HAMR), which will greatly increase drive capacities. Magnetic grains can only become so small before they start flipping randomly. Heating the disk can make the bits more stable by decreasing the platter coercively. This will record data by storing 1 bit in a single grain rather than a group of grains storing 1 bit. It is predicted by 2019 that 20 TB will fit on one drive. Magnetic storage has been one of the most common used storage devices for the past century and will likely be one of the main storage devices for the next couple decades.

        <h2> Protected Memory </h2>
        <br>
        Protected memory is a system where each program is given an area of memory to use and is not permitted to go outside that range. Use of protected memory greatly enhances both the reliability and security of a computer system.

        Without protected memory, it is possible that a bug in one program will alter the memory used by another program. This will cause that other program to run off of corrupted memory with unpredictable results. If the operating system's memory is corrupted, the entire computer system may crash and need to be rebooted. At times programs intentionally alter the memory used by other programs. This is done by viruses and malware to take over computers. It may also be used benignly by desirable programs which are intended to modify other programs; in the modern age, this is generally considered bad programming practice for application programs, but it may be used by system development tools such as debuggers, for example to insert breakpoints or hooks.

        Protected memory assigns programs their own areas of memory. If the operating system detects that a program has tried to alter memory that does not belong to it, the program is terminated (or otherwise restricted or redirected). This way, only the offending program crashes, and other programs are not affected by the misbehavior (whether accidental or intentional).

        Protected memory systems almost always include virtual memory as well.
